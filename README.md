# BlackWall-Core

**BlackWall-Core** is a modular, AI-powered cybersecurity defense engine designed and developed entirely by [Basil Abdullah Alzahrani](https://orcid.org/0000-0006-8864-8363). It integrates anomaly detection (RZA), trust scoring (TVM), and deception-based mitigation (FPP) into a unified system to detect, classify, and respond to modern cyber threats â€” especially unknown or zero-day attacks.

## ðŸ§  Modules Overview

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **RZA** (Reverse Zero-Day Algorithm) | Detects unknown or anomalous behaviors using AI/ML-based scoring. |
| **TVM** (Trust Verification Module) | Calculates context-aware trust scores based on behavior, identity, and conditions. |
| **FPP** (False Positive Protocol) | Decides whether to deceive, block, or allow based on combined intelligence. |

Each module operates independently but communicates via a secure signal bus, enabling real-time coordinated defense decisions.

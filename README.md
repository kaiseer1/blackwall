# BlackWall

**BlackWall-** is a modular, AI-powered cybersecurity defense engine designed and developed entirely by [Basil Abdullah Alzahrani](https://orcid.org/0000-0006-8864-8363). It integrates anomaly detection (RZA), trust scoring (TVM), and deception-based mitigation (FPP) into a unified system to detect, classify, and respond to modern cyber threats â€” especially unknown or zero-day attacks.

## ðŸ§  Modules Overview

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **RZA** (Reverse Zero-Day Algorithm) | Detects unknown or anomalous behaviors using AI/ML-based scoring. |
| **TVM** (Trust Verification Module) | Calculates context-aware trust scores based on behavior, identity, and conditions. |
| **FPP** (False Positive Protocol) | Decides whether to deceive, block, or allow based on combined intelligence. |

Each module operates independently but communicates via a secure signal bus, enabling real-time coordinated defense decisions.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/kaiseer1/BlackWall.git
cd BlackWall-defender


## Architecture:
-------------
Incoming Data
     â†“
  [ RZA ] â†’ Î´(t): anomaly score
     â†“
  [ TVM ] â†’ T(u, c): trust score
     â†“
  [ FPP ] â†’ F(x): threat certainty
     â†“
Final Decision:
- Allow
- Monitor
- Block + Deceive

Decision Logic:
---------------
If Î´(t) > Î¼ + kÏƒ AND T(u,c) < Ï„ AND F(x) > Î¸:
    â†’ Block + Deceive
Else if Î´(t) > Î¼ AND T(u,c) â‰¥ Ï„:
    â†’ Monitor
Else:
    â†’ Allow

Usage:
------
> python BlackWall.py

This will run a simulated attack scenario and display decisions based on AI logic.
